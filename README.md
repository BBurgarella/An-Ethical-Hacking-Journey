Welcome to my Ethical Hacking Journey
=====================================

in this repository, you will find the scripts and programm that I have developped and will develop in the future. My goal is to learn ethical hacking and therefore these files are mostly related to machines on Hack the box.

Here is the current list of files:
----------------------------------

-**CVE-2022-22204**: 
a python script to embed reverse shell payloads in images

-**Text_To_Image**: another python script with similar intents but this time the payload is on the image itself (to exploit vulnerabilities in image to text applications)
